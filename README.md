##React Learning Guide for Beginners
Overview of React
React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, especially for single-page applications.
It allows developers to create reusable UI components, making development more manageable and efficient.
Key Concepts
1. Components
Definition: Components are the foundational building blocks of any React application.
Types of Components:
Functional Components: Simple JavaScript functions that return a React element.
Class Components: More complex components defined using ES6 classes that can hold state and lifecycle methods.
2. JSX (JavaScript XML)
Definition: JSX is a syntax extension that enables writing HTML-like code within JavaScript files, allowing for more readable component structure.
3. State and Props
State: An internal object that stores a component's dynamic data, which can be changed over time, causing the component to re-render.
Props: Short for properties; these are read-only attributes that allow data to be passed from parent to child components.
4. Lifecycle Methods
Lifecycle Methods: Special functions in class components that manage behavior during different lifecycle stages, such as when a component mounts, updates, or unmounts.
